# NoShort Firefox Extension

A firefox extensions that can disable YouTube Shorts on the home page to avoid getting distracted by garbage short form brainrot. Works, but is not pretty and is a miracle that it does at all. I have no idea what I'm doing with extensions or blocking youtube content lol.

## Plans

Design some proper icons

Provide options for control
- whitelist
- blacklist
- improve on how each view is blocked
- Improve styling (create a theme thats not white with black text)
